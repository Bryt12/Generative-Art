## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Setup & Run

1. **Install `http-server`**:
   
   First, we need a local server to serve our p5js sketches. We'll use `http-server` for this. Install it globally using npm:

   npm install -g http-server

2. **Navigate to project**:

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've cloned this repository.

3. **Start the Server**:

   Run the following command to start http-server:

   ```bash
   http-server

4. **View in Browser**:

   Open your preferred web browser and visit:

   ```

   You'll see a list of folders, each corresponding to a different p5js sketch. Click on any folder to view that particular sketch.

## Exploring the Sketches

Each folder in the repository represents a unique p5js sketch. Inside each folder, you'll typically find:

- A sketch.js file: This is where the main p5js code for the sketch resides.
- An index.html file: The HTML file that loads the p5js library and the sketch.
- Other assets: Some sketches might have additional files like images, sounds, or other JavaScript files.
